        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine you are coordinating the drivers of a delivery company for freshly prepared food from restaurants.
            At any given
            time, you have suppliers at your disposal, each with different capacities and speeds, as well as their own
            roster.
            Over time, you receive orders that you pass on to restaurants. Over time, the restaurants will let you know
            how many
            boxes of packed food will be ready for collection and at what time. Your aim is to coordinate the drivers so
            that the
            food arrives at the customers as quickly and as hot as possible.
